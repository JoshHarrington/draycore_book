He never got tired of the view.

Standing on the edge of the defence section of the ship, you could see out and out, it never stopped. Some Dray said that they could see the planets about the closest stars that filled the screen.

Gorlak thought they must be lying, their eyes couldn’t be that much better than his. He didn’t care either way, he saw amazing beauty in the way the stars filled the view, the longer you looked, the more you’d see.

He was meant to be down in Engineering, listening, learning - actually doing what his apprenticeship was meant to be about. Despite being fond of his tutor, that didn’t stop him from spending longer and longer up here just staring. The feeling of his brain slowly emptying, anger retreating, being replaced by a calm quiet. He wanted nothing more than to be away from all of them. 

They knew he was different. He didn’t even need to do anything, they just seemed to feel it. They didn’t trust him. Conversation would stop when he came into a room, many would stare at him, others would just ignore him, trying their hardest to pretend he didn’t exist.

Most of the time he followed their example, ignored them right back, showed them that it didn’t bother him in the slightest.

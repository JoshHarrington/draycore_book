For the past couple of weeks Jane had been using K to disseminate some more interesting rumours about Jim’s thoughts on whether they should keep Gorlak in their camp or not.

By the time the debate rolled round most people were pretty sure on how Jim felt about Gorlak. Jane became more than a little concerned when she started to overhear comments in the mess hall, people rumbling on about how Jim was right - ‘that we should kick it out on its arse’ - ‘there’s no place for it’ - ‘we can’t feed it’ - ‘we’re not a charity!’. She’d been hoping that K’s rounds would have lead to an altogether more positive reaction from the group with people starting to actively distance themselves from the leader and his supposedly xenophobic comments.

The night of the debate Jane knew she had her work cut out, not only getting people on Gorlak’s side, but on her side too. They didn’t really know her, as far as most of them were concerned she was the moody assistant to the council, who rarely spoke and  when she did it was usually to ram some logic down someone’s throat. She didn’t rate her chances of pulling off this mutiny very highly.

The mess hall was rammed with people. There must be at least three hundred of them in the room. She always managed to forget that there was actually that number here, they always ate at different times and most people kept pretty solidarity lives wherever possible. It was a hot night, and the stink of BO was eye-wateringly bad. She stepped up to her thrown-together podium, which was actually a couple of stacked crates for keeping carrots in, which had been promoted for the occasion.

“Good evening everybody. Thank you for coming. We’re here to debate the status of our latest resident, Gorlak. He’s not of this world but in the short time that I’ve had to get to know him, I’ve learned that he is ferociously intelligent and incredibly passionate about the work that we’re doing here.” Jane didn’t anyone confused about where she sat on the issue.

Jim stood. “Thank you Jane.” He nodded in her direction. Looking out on the mass he gripped his potato crate as if he were about to deliver an historic speech. “Friends. This is not an easy decision to make. However, we need to be really clear on a few things. First off, we did not start this organisation as a precursor to getting involved in conflicts amongst species we know nothing about. I’ve communicated with Gorlak, and he seems like a sensible enough being, but I have no way of knowing if he is genuine in his beliefs or in his record of how he ended up at our door.”

At this point there was a loud creak as the doors at the end of canteen were slowly pushed open by a massive crumpled shadow.
“Sorry am I interrupting? - my ears were burning.” Gorlak chuckled to himself.

“Ah, Gorlak, you made it.” Jim’s eye began twitching and his smile became just slightly too forced.

“Couldn’t miss my own trial now could I?” Gorlak had shuffled most of the length of the hall by this point, he was in no rush to get to a seat. The people of the Ourea quickly spread before him creating a path to the debate circle. The crutches Jane had taped together to support him when walking were creaking ominously under his weight.

He finally made it to the front row of seats, several of which had randomly become vacant shortly before he had got to them. Lowering himself carefully into a couple of battered chairs, he laid his crutch next to his seat, he breathed and nodded to Jim to continue.

Jim’s fingers had gone white gripping the cheap wood of the crate. He gave a sharp nod, gulped, looked down to his notes amongst the vegetables, had he lost one? He had been saying something about the alien being shifty, always keeping to shadows? He cleared his throat.

“Erm, yes, so as I was saying. We don’t know if we can trust him, you - Gorlak.” Jim met the alien’s eye, but only for a second before staring out into the crowd. “We only have his account of the events that lead up to him becoming injured and we have no way of verifying them. If we let him stick around, it will seem to any interested parties that we have taken a side - a side in a war that we neither understand nor consent to being part of.”

“So what? You want us to chuck him out to be mauled by those monsters again?” A voice from the crowd that Jane could have sworn was K’s, followed by a general murmur of assent. Maybe that kid was going to useful after all.

How Jim wished he could be back by the fire in his hut. “We’d do everything we could for him, we’d get him whatever rations or provisions we can afford. We just don’t want to be in the middle of this … this war!”

“You mean you don’t want to do something real! You’re just a coward!” There was the voice again, the murmuring was getting a lot more audible now. Jane felt like they were about four minutes away from a full on riot. 

“Do you mind if I say something?” Gorlak’s raspy voice silenced the crowd in a heartbeat as everyone waited for him to speak.

“I never meant to bring conflict to your door. I apologise for bringing you all into this. But kicking me out is not going to solve your problems. Now that you’ve hosted me for some 6 weeks, there’s no doubt the Draycore scouts know where I am and who you are.” Jane felt her heart quicken. There was a communal intake of breath.

“Whatever you do from now on, you’re going to be on their hit-list for aiding a known rebel. Even if you kill me…” Gorlak looked up to Jim, who had shrunk behind his potato crates trying to fade into a shadow that didn’t exist.

Gorlak continued “… even that won’t solve your problems. It will prove to the Draycore that you have the knowledge and resources to kill one of them, which would make you even more of a threat.”

“So, to conclude, if I leave you’re f*cked, if I stay you’re f*cked.”

Jane found herself gawping at the reclining alien. Had he not heard a word she’d said?! What about letting them warm to him, not scaring them to quickly, letting Jim talk and make a fool of himself.

Jane’s brain had already assimilated the new information and was adjusting the speech and the plan to fit.

“He’s lovely when you get to know him…” She joked to the non-responsive mob.

She continued knowing that what she said right now would be the difference between life or death for Gorlak and likely the entire camp. “As Gorlak says, we’re f*cked either way. But he fails to mention one fact, that we are a hell of a lot stronger with him as part of our ranks than if we kick him out. His knowledge and understanding of the Draycore force will help us defend ourselves from their scouts in the short-term and their full-scale assault that is undoubtably on the way.”

There were murmurs of agreement through the room who thirty seconds previously were about ready to run out of the place screaming.

It looked like Jane speech had woken Jim from his mini-breakdown. “Nope. No way. We can’t have him here, it’s not safe for any of us.”

Jim’s eyes started madly searching the room for an ally. He didn’t find one.

“I didn’t start this organisation to be pushed around by people like you!” He shouted out at the crowd, many of whom found the outburst rather amusing.

“Jim. There’s two ways this could go, be logical!” Jane started speaking directly to Jim, knowing full well that the whole room would be paying attention to her. “We could ask Gorlak to leave and then the Draycore scouts will attack us in within the month - just to find out where he went - and I’m guessing they wouldn’t leave anyone to talk about it. The alternative is that we ask Gorlak to stay. He can help us prepare for any attack, plus he’s already shown his ability by fighting them off before, they’d be less inclined to storm the base with Gorlak here.”

Jim seemed to regain his composure for a second. “Is that how you all feel?” The crowd, like some massive awkward beast groaned and muttered it’s approval. Jim had been their leader for the last three years but as many were beginning to realise, he was far more interested in the theory than the reality of running the Ourea. He enjoyed his fireside Chaise Lounge and talking big about what he would do if they ever met alien life. Well now here it was and Jim was freaking out.

The power in the room had shifted, no-one needed to say it, everyone just knew it.

Jane realised that this was her moment, if she didn’t act now then it would be lost and it would take months for her to build up the same level of support. “I call for a vote. Those who believe we should welcome Gorlak into our number and weather the oncoming storm together raise your hand.”

For a split-second Jane thought she’d misjudged the whole situation as no hands appeared, but then someone in the middle of the mob stuck up their hand, quickly followed by more and more until a forest of arms had sprung up. 

Gorlak - who up until the vote had been lazing out on his set of seats, trying hard to look casual - stood painfully, the backs of the chairs nearly snapping under his weight as he hoisted himself up. From his face, you couldn’t tell if he was enjoying his moment or not, after surveying the crowd and mentally noting all those who had abstained, he lowered himself back down.

“Thank you.” Jane continued. “It pains me to do this, but as a second motion, I call for a vote of no-confidence in our leader’s abilities.” She let her eyes find Jim’s, who was sitting quietly, clearly stunned by the turn of events.
“Those who agree, please again raise your hands.” In even less time than they’d taken previously, hands were shooting up.

No one looked directly at Jim during the process. They wouldn’t even meet each other’s eyes.

But before you all agreed to that plan, which I would of course go along with without a fight, can I just explain a little of my people and the predicament we’re in.” His huge skull spun slowly a little to the left and right before continuing.

“We’re called Dray. We had a home once. But that changed when the rebel faction called the Draycore began wiping the populations of peaceful planets out of existence. As humans I imagine this is not going to be a struggle for you to understand, you’ve been invading and destroying peaceful settlements for thousands of years - in the name of resource collection and protection.” 

“The Draycore are not so bothered about resources as you are here on Earth, our planet and surrounding meteors provide more than enough material for any project that we could think of. The Draycore is bothered more, by any planet that it considers a possible threat to the Dray mother-world, and doles out heavy punishment to any such planet. Now you might be thinking that this sounds reasonable, right? That this would almost make sense? That you don’t want people attacking you so you might as well throw the first and last punch? Well then you’d probably like the way they do things over there.”

“However, the Dray mother-world that I mentioned was the reason for them searching for and removing these possible threats didn’t take too kindly to their name being used for this purpose. They banished the Draycore - with the promise that they will never be allowed to return to the mother-world. So, now you just have the Draycore floating about with weapons that can level planets, lost and alone, never allowed to go home. That’d be the end of the story right? Erm, not so much. After a decade - by your measure - of joyous destruction of a series of planets not too far from the home-world they were set upon by an army of Dray from the mother-world.”

“Beaten and humiliation the Draycore ship moved out from that corner of the galaxy as quickly as it could. It then spent the next two centuries searching for a new home and for a way to return, with or without the permission of the mother-worlders.”

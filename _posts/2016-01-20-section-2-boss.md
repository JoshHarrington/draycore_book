Jane knew that there was still an expectation for men to be leaders and women to be less important or less noticed. She’d known this from her days in the military and from the early days in the Ourea. Knowing something existed didn’t make it any less annoying. She was constantly aware of herself, ensuring that everyone was aware who was in charge whilst forcing herself not to look like she was trying too hard to be noticed and respected.

Tim was an especially difficult character to judge how to deal with. There was a time when homosexuality was seen as fault, as a psychological problem that needed to be fixed. That people who ‘suffered’ from this condition would be naturally more effeminate and more inclined to take orders instead of giving them. The fact that Tim was gay was a fact that didn’t even cross Jane’s mind most of the time, it was just a fact. He was an excellent soldier, brave, smart and followed orders to the letter. It was only when Jane had to give him a new set of orders that she knew he would find less than agreeable that she started the discussion in her head again of how best to deal with this character. At these times she found herself trying to empathise with someone who still had the lingering notion of prejudice hanging over him, in a similar sort of way she felt hanging over her sometimes.

Jane became aware of a presence at her door. Tim had arrived to collect some more information about the next target they planned to attack. Despite how close she had felt to him at one time, she’d found over recent months that he’d become more insular and aggressive in meetings, seeming to always vote for the course of action which kept Gorlak out of the spotlight and the media’s attention focussed on something other than their mysterious alien companion.

~~Jane had begun feeling a little uneasy around Tim, she trusted him, she knew that he was a good person but she felt that his relationship to Gorlak might be clouding his judgement.~~


Their collective - the Ourea, or the Children as they were more commonly known - had been built on the notion of peace and friendship for all intelligence in the galaxy. At the time of their organisations inception Earth had only heard whispers of intelligent life in the Universe but it seemed to the Ourea that those ideals - such as of peace to all sentient life - should be defined now before they had to be tested. They wanted a rulebook, a moral code, a treaty by which they could live and something that could act as a basis of a relationship with whatever was out there.

It was these aspects which really appealed to Gorlak. He’d been surrounded by dominance and aggression most of his life, this choice for peace before the fight even began was what made them stand out to Gorlak during his research of Earth. During his preparation for his scout mission he’d been tasked with compiling and categorising all possible threats and issues with the planned Draycore attack. Through his months spent researching all these beings on that little rock he was about to be hurled towards, he started to feel close to them. He felt like finally he could find a clan of his own, some people of principle who cared more about peace than ownership or power. Little did he know, that the Ourea were just a rambling group of hippie misfits who had some wonderful sounding aims without any particular direction or plan. Many were more passionate about the weed they grew in their back gardens than the point of their organisation.

They only really became the Ourea after he found them.

Their mission and focus became crystallised around Gorlak. Some of them had taken that to heart more than others. Tim always seemed to read situations only from the perspective of what harm  might come to their near-invulnerable local Dray. You might think that becoming as close as Tim had to a being who could heal himself within seconds from wounds that would kill any human might imbue a partner with a feeling of security. Instead this only seemed to add to Tim’s paranoia and his obsession with Gorlak’s safety - as if his abilities had only helped to paint a target on his back. 

Jane realised that she was probably one of the only people in their base who could empathise with this protective urge. When she’d found Gorlak, in that broken state, all she’d wanted to do was keep him safe. Now Tim had seemed to take that on as his core duty. Gorlak had recently confided in her that Tim had pledged to never let any harm come to him. Gorlak had laughed it off, believing that the human was joking, but as Tim seemed to become more and more committed to the idea - the less funny the situation seemed. Jane just hoped that Tim wouldn’t end up putting himself or others in danger for the sake of Gorlak, who whilst ridiculously valuable to all of them, could take care of himself.

The door creaked as Tim leaned into the room - drawing Jane out of her daydream. “Afternoon sir!” Jane said shooting him a weary smile.

“Hi Jane.” He spoke softly, his voice completely at odds with his massive frame. “Have you got a minute to go through this mission brief?” Tim eyes betrayed his emotional state, he looked a little wary and confused, this was the first time he’d been picked to lead a group on a mission like this.

“Yep, of course, come on in. You alright?” Jane sighed, rubbing her eyes and leaning back into her ancient desk chair.

“Yeah,” His eyes softened slightly. “I’m good thanks.” He still looked quizzical, but Jane noticed him breathe out and let his shoulders drop a little. “Mind if I sit?” He started to take a step towards the only other carcass of a chair in the tiny room.

“Sure.” Jane found her face trying to convey the warmth of friendship she wasn’t feeling.

“So, who we going after General?” Tim spoke with a constrained energy. 

Jane decided to just go with her gut and to stop trying to analyse every detail of his body language.

She quickly explained between sips of cold coffee from her favourite cracked mug, how they’d decided to focus on a politician who most of the Ourea were well aware of. Senator Tidir Akachi, representative for Nigeria on the World Council, had recently increased her output of acidic rhetoric concerning the activities and morals of the Ourea. Akachi had never agreed with the Ourea, their mission or the fact that they were protecting Gorlak, however, in recent months her attacks on the organisation had seem to ratchet up to a whole new level. She’d started attacking them, whenever and wherever she was given a platform. It was like she was becoming obsessed. She had a small and vocal following of similar fanatics who proclaimed her as a shining light in modern politics, a woman of the people. Jane thought it was strange how the old “us and them” psychology never managed to get old. It was always the movements that spoke of the differences between people that managed to engage a populace that had become bored of sedate and peaceful politics.

It was completely possible that this councillor was just bad-mouthing them for the sake of it, maybe she was being paid off, maybe she was acting on behalf of a more shady character in the background. Whatever the case they thought it was worth investigating, if only from a self-preservation standpoint. The Ourea council had suspicions that there was something else going on with this renegade politician, more than just a tirade of xenophobia without particular focus. The council had voted to investigate Akachi and if necessary, extract her to the Castle compound. Many on the council firmly believed that this was the work of the Draycore scouts that had formed the crew on Gorlak’s trip to Earth.

“You really think this all might be because there’s a Dray controlling this Senator? Forcing her to say whatever it wants?” This was a subject close to both of their heart - the difference between Gorlak and his people. They had to keep reminding themselves that just because Gorlak was kind, gentle and honest - his species were no pushovers. At every point Gorlak had to force himself into a shape that was acceptable for humans, and even then he still got it wrong. Sometimes he was too agressive when an argument didn’t go the way he wanted, or he let himself get carried away in training practise - leaving people in the hospital for weeks. What would it be like meeting Dray who didn’t set the boundaries that Gorlak did, what damage could they do if they set their considerable brainpower to it.

“I’ve no idea. Maybe. Maybe there are Draycore agents out there pulling strings as they wish, playing games with us and the media.” She sighed. “But my gut says they wouldn’t bother playing this game, that they would just get on with whatever mission they had, completely ignore the humans that got in their way. Why would they need to use the media like Akachi is doing?”

“That confusion, the lack of clarity is why we need more information. We need to know if Akachi is a danger to us or herself. We need to know if it might be necessary to remove her from the reach of whoever might be trying to control her.”

Tim nodded. “I get it. But what would the media say if they found out about us kidnapping Akachi? Is it worth extracting her if she’s just a bigoted nuisance?”

“No, of course not.” Jane gave herself a second to find the right words. ”She can say whatever she wants to, it’s still a free world - for the moment. That doesn’t bother us, if she starts stoking people up against us then yeah we’d need to protect ourselves but I can’t imagine that’ll involve her.” 

“Right. Let’s say it’s all true, that the Draycore agents are there, they’re controlling her through whatever method and that we decide to ‘save her’. Why would she even believe that we’re any better than them, she might have been brainwashed by them or they might have her family hostage.”

~~If we bring her back here where she starts doing interviews about how awful her experience was and that the Draycore are evil and we should blast them from existence… That wouldn’t help our cause?”~~

“I’m not sure why you’re trying to fault here where there is none. We’re planning on saving this person because it’s the right thing to do, full stop. If you’re not the person for the job then I’ll find somebody else.”

Tim took a breath. “Sorry Jane. I find myself always trying to see the agendas in people’s plans, even the council. I trust you, I hope you know that. Gorlak believes in you, that’s a pretty strong recommendation in my book. I’m the person for this, if you’ll have me.”

Jane looked at him sideways and leaned back in her chair. With a little shake of her head she spoke. “Well ok then, let’s get you sorted.”

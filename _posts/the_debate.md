For the past couple of weeks Jane had been using K to disseminate some more interesting rumours about Tom’s thoughts on whether they should keep Gorlak in their camp or not.

By the time the debate rolled round most people were pretty sure on how Tom felt about Gorlak. Jane became more than a little concerned when she started to overhear comments in the mess hall with people rumbling on about how Tom was right - ‘that we should kick it out on its arse’ - ‘there’s no place for it’, ‘we can’t feed it’ - ‘we’re not a charity!’. She’d been hoping that K’s rounds would have lead to an altogether more positive reaction from the group with people starting to actively distance themselves from the leader and his supposedly xenophobic comments.

The night of the debate Jane knew she had her work cut out, not only getting people on Gorlak’s side, but on her side too. They didn’t really know her, as far as most of them were concerned she was the moody assistant to the council, who rarely spoke and  when she did it was usually to ram some logic down someone’s throat. She didn’t rate her chances of pulling of this mutiny very highly.

The mess hall was rammed with people. There must be at least three hundred of them in the room. She always managed to forget that there was actually that number her, they always ate at different times and most people kept pretty solidarity lives wherever possible. It was a hot night, and the stink of BO was eye-waveringly bad. She stepped up to her thrown-together podium, which was actually a crate for keeping carrots in which had been promoted for the occasion.

“Good evening everybody. Thank you for coming along. We’re here to debate the status of our latest resident, Gorlak. He’s not of this world but in the short time that I’ve had to get to know him, I’ve learned that he is ferociously intelligent and incredibly passionate about the work that we’re doing here.” Jane didn’t anyone confused about where she sat on the issue.

Tom stood. “Thank you Jane.” He nodded in her direction. Looking out on the mass he gripped his potato crate as if he were about to deliver an historical speech. “Friends. This is not an easy decision to make. However, we need to be really clear on a few things. First off, we did not start this organisation as a precursor to getting involved in a conflict amongst a species we know nothing about. I’ve communicated with Gorlak, and he seems like a sensible enough being, but I have no way of knowing if he is genuine in his beliefs or in his record of how he ended up at our doors.”

At this point there was a loud creak as the doors at the end of canteen were slowly pushed open by a massive crumbled shadow.
“Sorry am I interrupting? - my ears were burning.” Gorlak chuckled to himself.

“Ah, Gorlak, you made it.” Tom spoke with a nervous twinge in his voice.

“Couldn’t miss my own trial now could I?” Gorlak had shuffled most of the length of the hall by this point, he was in no rush to get to a seat.

He finally made it to the front row of seats, several of which had randomly become vacant shortly before he had got to them. Lowering himself carefully into the creaking chair and laying his crutches next to his seat, he breathed and nodded to Tom to continue.

Tom seemed rather shaken by the whole thing, he had no idea where he’d got up to - hadn’t he been saying something about not being to trust the alien.

“Erm, yes, so as I was saying. We don’t know if we can trust him. We only have his account of the events that lead up to him becoming injured and we have no way of verifying them. If we let him stick around, it will seem to any interested parties that we have taken a side - a side in a war that we neither understand nor consent to being part of.”

“So what? You want us to chuck him out to be mauled by those monsters again?” A voice from the crowd that Jane could have sworn was K’s, followed by a general murmur of assent. Maybe that kid was going to useful after all.

How Tom wished he could be back by the fire in his hut. “We’d do everything we could for him, we’d get him whatever rations or provisions we could afford. We just don’t want to be in the middle of this thing.”

“You mean you don’t want to be in the middle of it. Coward!” There was the voice again, the murmuring was getting a lot more audible now. Jane felt like they were about four minutes away from a full on riot. 

“Do you mind if I say something?” A raspy voice echoed around the space as all the eyes in the room swivelled to hear the alien speak.

“I never meant to bring this war to your door. Tom’s right, it would be easier for you to kick me out than have me stay. But before you all agreed to that plan, which I would of course go along with without a fight, can I just explain a little of my people and the predicament we’re in.” His huge skull spun slowly a little to the left and right before continuing.

“We’re called Dray. We had a home once. But that changed when the rebel faction called the Draycore began wiping the populations of peaceful planet out of existence. As humans I imagine this is not going to be a struggle for you to understand, you’ve been invading and destroying peaceful settlements for thousands of years - in the name of resource collection and protection.” 

“The Draycore are not so bothered about resources as you are here on Earth, our planet and surrounding meteors provide more than enough material for any project that we could think of. The Draycore is bothered more by any planet that it considers a possible threat to the Dray mother-world, and doles out heavy punishment to any such planet. Now you might be thinking that this sounds reasonable, right? That this would almost make sense? That you don’t want people attacking you so you might as well throw the first and last punch? Well then you’d probably like the way they do things over there.”

“However, the Dray mother-world that I mentioned was the reason for them searching for and removing these possible threats didn’t take too kindly to their name being used for this purpose. They banished the Draycore - with the promise that they will never be allowed to return to the mother-world. So, now you just have the Draycore floating about with weapons that can level planets, lost and alone, never allowed to go home. That’d be the end of the story right? Erm, not so much. After a decade - by your measure - of joyous destruction of a series of planets not too far from the home-world they were set upon by an army of Dray from the mother-world.”

“Beaten and humiliation the Draycore ship moved out from that corner of the galaxy as quickly as it could. It then spent the next two centuries searching for a new home and for a way to return, with or without the permission of the mother-worlders.”
